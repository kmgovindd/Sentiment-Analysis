# Sentiment Analysis of YouTube and Amazon Reviews

This repository contains the implementation of a sentiment analysis project focusing on reviews from YouTube and Amazon. The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models to classify the sentiment of user-generated reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.

## Project Overview
**Data Sources**: Reviews were collected from YouTube and Amazon.

**Objective**: To analyze and classify the sentiment of the reviews using NLP techniques.
**Tech Stack**: Python, NLP libraries (e.g., NLTK, spaCy), Machine Learning libraries (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow).
**Key Features**:

1. Data preprocessing including text cleaning, tokenization, and vectorization.
2. Implementation of various sentiment analysis models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, LSTM).
3. Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Visualization of sentiment distribution and model performance.
